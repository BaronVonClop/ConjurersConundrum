# ConjurersConundrum
A small fetish game developed by Baron Von Clop.

You play as a conjurer in Azeroth who participates in a yearly challenge among the magical elite: you hire on an apprentice for a month, and whoever can fatten up their new hire the most in that time, wins.

It is dumb as shit and fetishy but I don't care; I wanted to learn JavaFX GUI and figured this would be a fun experiment to run with.

You can visit the website which contains a devblog at http://conjurersconundrum.info.

The game is not currently in a playable state. Well it is, but nothing happens. Compile it if you want but there's really no reason.
